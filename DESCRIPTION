Description: Tree-ring fire histories are shared publicly on the IMPD,
    a web-based resource hosted by NOAAâ€™s World Data Service for 
    Paleoclimatology (WDS-Paleo). {rIMPD} enables fast and easy IMPD 
    exploration via search calls to the IMPD API, thus requiring an 
    internet connection to work. Search results return tidy metadata 
    and raw tree-ring fire history data, which can be visualized and 
    analyzed using the {burnr} R package.
